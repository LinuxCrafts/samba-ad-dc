# This directory is intended to contain local settings overrides
#
# Though shipped settings in /samba/etc/smb.conf can still be modified by an
# administrator, it's recommended for additions or the occasional override, to 
# adjust them here, to prevent future updates from interfering # with local 
# modifications.
#
# Keep in mind that all shares should use numbers above 90, for example
# 91-homes.conf, 92-printers.conf, 93-users-profiles.conf.
#
# Some configuration are provided as examples, you can start by modifing them
